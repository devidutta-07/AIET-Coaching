            <h2 class="section-title">Our Story</h2>
            <div class="story-content">
                <p>AIET Coaching Center was founded with a simple belief: technology education should be accessible to everyone. Our founder, recognizing the gap in quality computer training and PGDCA courses in rural areas like Jajpur, started AIET to bridge that divide.</p>
                <p>What began as a small initiative has grown into a thriving community of learners, mentors, and professionals. Today, we're proud to have trained hundreds of students in Jajpur and Odisha who are now working in tech companies, pursuing higher education, or starting their own ventures.</p>
                <p>We remain committed to our core values: affordability, quality, and accessibility. Every computer course we design, every student we mentor, and every partnership we build is guided by our mission to democratize tech education in rural Odisha.</p>
